The assignment requires developing a software architecture for the control of a robot in the environment. The {\bfseries{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}} node must be modelled as a R\+OS action server. During the simulation, the user can press \char`\"{}1\char`\"{} to give a random goal to the robot, and then press \char`\"{}0\char`\"{} to stop the robot.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Nodes and program description}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
In the assignment there are four different program used to achieve the goal required by the assignment. The program are writtten two in Python and two in C++\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The first one, {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{go__to__point_8py}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point.\+py}}}}, is an {\itshape action server} used to reach a given goal. This node use a publisher, which publishes the velocity of the robot through the {\itshape cmd\+\_\+vel} topic, and a subscriber, which checks the position of the robot through the {\itshape odom} topic. If a new goal is set, this node fix the yaw angle in order to be aligned with the goal, then the robot can go straight towards the target point and finally, when the robot is near the desired position, it can fix the final yaw angle in order to have the same orientation of the given goal. During these operations, the node checks continuously if the goal is canceled in order to stop the robot.
\item The second one, {\bfseries{user\+\_\+interface.\+py}}, is a client used to read the user command and to send it to the {\bfseries{state\+\_\+machine}} node. This node sends the new command through the service message {\itshape Command} and has an action client, which is connected to {\bfseries{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}}. If the user presses \char`\"{}1\char`\"{}, the node sends a \char`\"{}\+\_\+start\+\_\+\char`\"{} message to the {\itshape user\+\_\+interface} server; if the user types \char`\"{}0\char`\"{}, the node cancels the goal, using the action client, and sends a \char`\"{}\+\_\+stop\+\_\+\char`\"{} message to the {\itshape user\+\_\+interface} server.
\item The third one, {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{position__service_8cpp}{position\+\_\+service.\+cpp}}}}, is a simple server that generates three random number. This node uses the service message {\itshape Random\+Position} which has as request the minimum and maximum value allowed for the x and y position, and it has as response the three coordinates of the random goal (x,y posiion and the orientation theta).
\item The last one, {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{state__machine_8cpp}{state\+\_\+machine.\+cpp}}}}, is a node used to communicate with all the other nodes. This one has a simple client, which is connected to the {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{position__service_8cpp}{position\+\_\+service.\+cpp}}}} in order to receive the next goal, a server, which receives the request done by the user through the {\bfseries{user\+\_\+interface.\+py}}, and an action client, which is used to send new goals and to check if a target is reached. Before start searching a new goal the state machine checks if there is a {\itshape Command} request from a client, then if the user command is \char`\"{}\+\_\+start\+\_\+\char`\"{} the node make a request to {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{position__service_8cpp}{position\+\_\+service.\+cpp}}}} receiving a goal between -\/5.\+0 and 5.\+0, regarding x and y position, and the theta orientation, then the state machine sends this goal to the server using the action client and waits for a result, which could be a \char`\"{}success\char`\"{} in case of goal reached and a \char`\"{}failure\char`\"{} in case of goal canceled.

In the folder {\itshape launch} there are two different launch files\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The first one, {\bfseries{gazebo\+Sim.\+launch}}, used to launch the Gazebo environment and to run the four nodes together.
\item The second one, {\bfseries{vrep\+Sim.\+launch}}, used to launch only the four nodes together.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{How to run the code}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Simulation with Gazebo}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
The package contains the nodes and the simulation environment for controlling a mobile robot in the Gazebo simulation environment. Before launching the node, please source your R\+OS workspace, just writing this on the terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source path\_your\_workspace/devel/setup.bash}
\end{DoxyCode}


To launch the nodes, please run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 gazeboSim.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Simulation with V\+Rep}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
You can also run the simulation using {\bfseries{V\+Rep}}. You need three different terminal to run this simulation. In the first one you need to source your R\+OS workspace (or sourcing directly ros.\+sh) and run roscore\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source path\_your\_workspace/devel/setup.bash}
\DoxyCodeLine{roscore}
\end{DoxyCode}


In the second terminal you need to launch {\bfseries{Coppelia\+Sim}}\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source path\_your\_workspace/devel/setup.bash}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd path\_CoppeliaSim/}
\DoxyCodeLine{./coppeliaSim.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


When the Coppelia\+Sim program is running, open the scene \char`\"{}vrep\+Scene\+R2\+D2.\+ttt\char`\"{} inside the rt2\+\_\+assignment1 package and start the simulation pressing play. In the last terminal launch the nodes\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source path\_your\_workspace/devel/setup.bash}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 vrepSim.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}
